### (Russian) Java developer, Java performance 'enthusiast'.

Programming languages: Java, Groovy and Rust.

Java frameworks/libraries/tools I know: 
1. ASM bytecode manipulation framework. (Core and Tree API)
2. Project Reactor. (I like reactive programming due to scalability, and simpicity)
3. Gradle. (I know this build tool rather well, I also can make gradle plugins if I need it)
4. JMH. (Just a beginner in microbenchmarks, I don't know many compiler side-effects)
5. JCStress. (For testing interesting concurrent effects)

I try to write my code as simple and clear as I can.

I really like to communicate with people which know more interesting things in Java performance than me.

Sometimes I like to use [JMM Specification rules](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-17.html) to prove correctness of my concurrent code when

I directly use java.lang.Thread, locks and other low level threading Java things...

I don't really like reflection API but I can use it if I really need it. (Same with ASM)

I also have this [repository](https://github.com/ExtraExtremeERA/TestJava) with usage examples of some Java libraries/frameworks/packages, where I study some interesting Java libraries, mainly focused on high performance.

I am also planning to optimize server software of computer game called "Minecarft" to practice performance engineering,

I had project where I was trying to optimize minecraft Forge-based server, but due to the small amount of knowledge 

I couldn't optimize it normally back then. So thanks for reading, i hope this info was useful to you.
