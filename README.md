## Denery or Daniel Dorofeev.
### (Don't use ExtraExtremeERA cuz idk why I called my github account this way)

### (Russian) Java/Scala developer, performance 'enthusiast'.

Programming languages: Java, Scala, Groovy and Rust.

Java/Scala frameworks/libraries/tools I know: 
1. ASM bytecode manipulation framework. (Core and Tree API)
2. Project Reactor. (I like reactive programming due to scalability, and simpicity)
3. Cats/Cats Effect. (Scala library for good FP support)
4. Tofu. (Scala library for additional stuff in Cats)
5. Gradle. (I know this build tool rather well, I also can make gradle plugins if I need it)
6. JMH. (Just a beginner in microbenchmarks, I don't know many compiler side-effects)
7. JCStress. (For testing interesting concurrent effects)

Some Facts:
------
* I try to write my code as simple and clear as I can.

* I like to write FP code in Scala with 'Tagless Final' style/pattern.

* I have organization called [XXR](https://github.com/xxr-mc) where I make interesting experimental projects,
mostly realted to modifying game called "Minecraft".

* I really like to communicate with people which know more interesting things in programming than me.

* Sometimes I like to learn theory more realted to Computer Science and use things like [JMM Specification rules](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-17.html) to prove correctness of my concurrent code, and I also like watch interesting Java/Scala conferences on youtube everyday.

* I don't really like reflection API/Bytecode manipulation etc. but I can use it if I really need it.

* I have this [repository](https://github.com/ExtraExtremeERA/TestJava) with usage examples of some Java libraries/frameworks/packages, where I study some interesting Java libraries, mainly focused on high performance.
